Who Am I?

I'm Matthew Hambrecht. I'm a computer enthusiast and a programmer with a high skill level for my age. I love to hang out with friends and the rest you will just have to discover on your journey throughout my website!

Hobbies


Sports

My favorite sport is hockey, but I also love playing lacrosse which is my back-up sport for spring when my hockey season is over. I've been playing hockey longer than I've been a programmer and that's saying something.

Programming


Image
I love programming when I'm not hanging out with friends, at sports or at school. Well technically I do sometimes code at school when I finish my work but other than that I usually only code at home.

Freetime

Like most kids my age, I love hanging out with my friends. Some of them I've gotten into programming, others I love hanging out and playing sports with. I usually play lacrosse, football or basketball with my friends as very few of the friends close to me play hockey.
